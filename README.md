# Omni-Cite

This is a command-line tool, written in Python 3, that aims to make it easy to cite a wide variety of sources
in `biblatex` compliant format, while being easy to extend by the community. The goal is to make sourcing easy and
painless, with as little manual editing as possible, while making comprehensive cites.

This tool is not meant as a replacement for tools such as JabRef, but as a companion. This tool is designed to create
biblatex references from as wide a range of sources as possible, while also being easy to extend and add more sources in
a simple language. While tools such as JabRef can reference many sources accurately, for most it simply guesses. This is
especially the case with websites. The goal of Omni-Cite is to seamlessly cite as many sources as possible, while
allowing the community to expand its supported sources quickly and easily.

## Currently Supported Sources
